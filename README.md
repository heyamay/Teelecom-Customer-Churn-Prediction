# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

## What is Customer Churn?
Customer churn is defined as when customers or subscribers discontinue doing business with a firm or service.

Customers in the telecom industry can choose from a variety of service providers and actively switch from one to the next. The telecommunications business has an annual churn rate of 15-25 percent in this highly competitive market.

Individualized customer retention is tough because most firms have a large number of customers and can't afford to devote much time to each of them. The costs would be too great, outweighing the additional revenue. However, if a corporation could forecast which customers are likely to leave ahead of time, it could focus customer retention efforts only on these "high risk" clients. The ultimate goal is to expand its coverage area and retrieve more customers loyalty. The core to succeed in this market lies in the customer itself.

Customer churn is a critical metric because it is much less expensive to retain existing customers than it is to acquire new customers.

To detect early signs of potential churn, one must first develop a holistic view of the customers and their interactions across numerous channels.As a result, by addressing churn, these businesses may not only preserve their market position, but also grow and thrive. More customers they have in their network, the lower the cost of initiation and the larger the profit. As a result, the company's key focus for success is reducing client attrition and implementing effective retention strategy.

Customer churn is a significant issue for big business companies. Companies are attempting to create methods for predicting customer churn to get a direct impact on getting more revenues, particularly in telecom companies. Finding these characteristics is crucial to ensure appropriate steps can be taken to reduce customer churn.

In this project, i made machine learning models to predict customers who churn and not churn. 
We will analyze three characteristics 
(1) services that the customer signed up for, 
(2) account information about the customer, and 
(3) demographic info. 
We use two machine learning models, K-Nearest Neighbors and Logistic Regression

## Dataset
The data set used for this article's classification problem is taken from Kaggle and IBM sample data set collection. 
[DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

### The data set includes information about:

- Customers who left within the last month â€“ the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for â€“ phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information â€“ how long theyâ€™ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers â€“ gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
## Implementation:

*Libraries:* sklearn, Matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and NumPy

## Conclusion
In this project, using the Telco Customer Churn dataset i have demonstrated an end-to-end machine learning project from beginning to end. Data cleaning and visualization were our first steps. Then, to give better data to train with the machine learning model we have to change categorical data to numerical data and we scale the numerical data (feature engineering). After that, we tried to build two machine-learning models and we evaluated that. Logistic regression has a high accuracy compared with KNN. The ability to recognize potential customer scenarios where churn can be prevented requires a high level of accuracy since the benefits of the customerâ€™s eventual returns must balance the expenses of associated retention initiatives.
